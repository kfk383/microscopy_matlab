## Information
This optical microscopy program was implemented to allow for quick and easy analysis of optical microscopy images. It accepts an image containing a scale bar and an assortment of particles, and will output a CSV file containing the number and computed, scaled areas of the particles in the image. The program supports area exclusion via free-draw or rectangle draw, for any portions of the image that are not desired in analysis. 

## How to Run the Program
This program has been implemented completely in MatLab R2018b. To ensure that this program works correctly, please check that your MatLab version matches this. 

To run the program, first clone this repository. Add the images you wish to analyse into the mic_matlab folder. Open the file **img_analysis_gui.fig**. An alternate way to do this is to open the file **img_analysis_gui.m**. Press "run" when the file has loaded, and click "Add Path" if prompted. Follow the steps written on the program to analyse an image.
